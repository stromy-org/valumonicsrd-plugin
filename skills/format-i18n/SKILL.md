description: "Maintain a deliverable that exists in several languages without the versions drifting apart. Reports exactly which translation units are missing, stale, current or obsolete for a target locale; returns only the units that must be translated; validates a translated batch against the source's protected tokens, placeholders, URLs, figures and terminology; and hands back a replacement target state for the caller to persist. Use when asked to translate a deliverable, add a language version, check whether a translation is up to date, find out what changed since the last translation, or work out why an English copy still has source-language text in it. Triggers on \"translate this\", \"add an English version\", \"is the translation current\", \"what changed since we translated it\", \"the translation is out of date\", \"half of it is still in Dutch\", \"keep the language versions in sync\"."

# Keeping language versions in step (MCP-hosted skill)

This skill's full instructions are hosted on the `stromy-format` MCP server. Do not hardcode workflow logic locally — always fetch the live version from the MCP.

## Loading instructions

1. Read the main skill instructions:
   → call the `fs_read` tool on the `stromy-format` MCP with `path="skills/format-i18n/SKILL.md"`.

2. Discover reference files (and any other skill assets), then read on demand:
   → call `fs_list` with `path="skills/format-i18n"` (and `path="skills/format-i18n/references"`),
   → call `fs_read` with `path="skills/format-i18n/references/<file>"`.

Follow the instructions returned by the MCP exactly.

## This MCP is the only correct path

Produce this skill's output **only** by following the live SKILL.md fetched above and calling the `stromy-format` MCP's own tools. Do **not** substitute a local or identically-named base skill from elsewhere, and do **not** invent your own output path. A locally-produced or unbranded artifact is **wrong output, not a fallback** — it bypasses the server-side brand and quality gates.
