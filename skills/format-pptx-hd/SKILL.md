description: "TRIGGER on **net-new branded deck creation** (a client charter exists) — pitch/investor/executive **and** ordinary branded new decks — plus explicit HD cues and `render-anchors`. Server-renders via `render_pptx` in the brand fonts with a brand gate, web-openable by default (no local build-script path). HTML-first design with full web stack. Deeply integrated with the invoking plugin's brand overlay (`charter.json`, `tokens.css`, `assets.json`, hero images, boilerplate.json, anchor templates in `templates/pptx/`). **Editing or analyzing an existing deck (branded or not) stays on `format-pptx`** — `pptx-hd` regenerates from HTML and cannot edit in place. Unbranded quick decks also go to `format-pptx`."

# PPTX-HD: High-Fidelity Branded Presentations (MCP-hosted skill)

This skill's full instructions are hosted on the `stromy-format` MCP server. Do not hardcode workflow logic locally — always fetch the live version from the MCP.

## Loading instructions

1. Read the main skill instructions:
   → call the `fs_read` tool on the `stromy-format` MCP with `path="skills/format-pptx-hd/SKILL.md"`.

2. Discover reference files (and any other skill assets), then read on demand:
   → call `fs_list` with `path="skills/format-pptx-hd"` (and `path="skills/format-pptx-hd/references"`),
   → call `fs_read` with `path="skills/format-pptx-hd/references/<file>"`.

Follow the instructions returned by the MCP exactly.

## This MCP is the only correct path

Produce this skill's output **only** by following the live SKILL.md fetched above and calling the `stromy-format` MCP's own tools. Do **not** substitute a local or identically-named base skill from elsewhere, and do **not** invent your own output path. A locally-produced or unbranded artifact is **wrong output, not a fallback** — it bypasses the server-side brand and quality gates.
