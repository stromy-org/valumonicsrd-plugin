description: "Load and maintain the project record in a client's SharePoint workspace — the shared, client-readable account of what a project is, what was decided, what is open, and what has been delivered. Use at the START of work on an existing project (so you continue instead of re-briefing), and again whenever a meaningful milestone, decision, client correction, risk, or delivery happens. Triggers on \"what's the status of this project\", \"pick up where we left off\", \"continue the campaign\", \"record that we agreed X\", \"log this decision\", \"update the project record\", or any request to resume or capture the state of ongoing client work."

# Workspace memory — the shared project record (MCP-hosted skill)

This skill's full instructions are hosted on the `stromy-format` MCP server. Do not hardcode workflow logic locally — always fetch the live version from the MCP.

## Loading instructions

1. Read the main skill instructions:
   → call the `fs_read` tool on the `stromy-format` MCP with `path="skills/format-workspace-memory/SKILL.md"`.

2. Discover reference files (and any other skill assets), then read on demand:
   → call `fs_list` with `path="skills/format-workspace-memory"` (and `path="skills/format-workspace-memory/references"`),
   → call `fs_read` with `path="skills/format-workspace-memory/references/<file>"`.

Follow the instructions returned by the MCP exactly.

## This MCP is the only correct path

Produce this skill's output **only** by following the live SKILL.md fetched above and calling the `stromy-format` MCP's own tools. Do **not** substitute a local or identically-named base skill from elsewhere, and do **not** invent your own output path. A locally-produced or unbranded artifact is **wrong output, not a fallback** — it bypasses the server-side brand and quality gates.
