description: "Author a premium branded explainer / educational VIDEO — a server-rendered MP4 with animated titles, kinetic typography, animated diagrams (process-flow), animated data (data-bars + KPI count-ups), image reveals, captions, and optional voiceover/music. Storyboard-first and accuracy-gated: plans a scene-by-scene shot list with a per-scene source citation, runs the voice cascade, then renders via the async `render_video` MCP tool with a brand gate + a per-scene visual-review pass before delivery. Deeply integrated with the invoking plugin's brand overlay (`brand_context.json`, `assets.json`). USE THIS whenever someone wants a video, explainer video, animated explainer, motion-graphics video, product / strategy / plan walkthrough, or to turn a brief, plan, or report into a branded video — even if they don't say 'video'. Content is condensed, accurate, and well-structured — never fabricated. Server-rendered (Playwright + ffmpeg), brand-required (no unbranded path). SIBLINGS — pick the right one: a low-level HTML→MP4 clip to drop into a deck/PDF → format-motion; generative AI footage (Veo/Kling talking-head/b-roll) → video-production; an editable branded deck → format-pptx-hd."

# Video-HD: Branded Explainer Videos (MCP-hosted skill)

This skill's full instructions are hosted on the `stromy-format` MCP server. Do not hardcode workflow logic locally — always fetch the live version from the MCP.

## Loading instructions

1. Read the main skill instructions:
   → call the `fs_read` tool on the `stromy-format` MCP with `path="skills/format-video-hd/SKILL.md"`.

2. Discover reference files (and any other skill assets), then read on demand:
   → call `fs_list` with `path="skills/format-video-hd"` (and `path="skills/format-video-hd/references"`),
   → call `fs_read` with `path="skills/format-video-hd/references/<file>"`.

Follow the instructions returned by the MCP exactly.

## This MCP is the only correct path

Produce this skill's output **only** by following the live SKILL.md fetched above and calling the `stromy-format` MCP's own tools. Do **not** substitute a local or identically-named base skill from elsewhere, and do **not** invent your own output path. A locally-produced or unbranded artifact is **wrong output, not a fallback** — it bypasses the server-side brand and quality gates.
