description: "High-fidelity branded PDF creation using HTML-first design with the full web stack (CSS gradients, web fonts, SVG, paged-media CSS). Server-renders via the `render_pdf` MCP tool (Playwright/Chromium + brand gate) — no local build script. Deeply integrated with the invoking plugin's brand overlay (`brand_context.json`, `assets.json`, hero images). Use when asked to create branded proposals, executive briefs, brand books, policy reports, case studies, white papers, or any client-facing PDF where visual quality matters. Triggers on: 'create branded PDF', 'build proposal PDF', 'design a brief', 'brand book PDF', 'high quality PDF', 'HD PDF', 'magazine-style PDF', or any request for visually polished branded paginated output."

# PDF-HD: High-Fidelity Branded PDFs (MCP-hosted skill)

This skill's full instructions are hosted on the `stromy-format` MCP server. Do not hardcode workflow logic locally — always fetch the live version from the MCP.

## Loading instructions

1. Read the main skill instructions:
   → call the `fs_read` tool on the `stromy-format` MCP with `path="skills/format-pdf-hd/SKILL.md"`.

2. Discover reference files (and any other skill assets), then read on demand:
   → call `fs_list` with `path="skills/format-pdf-hd"` (and `path="skills/format-pdf-hd/references"`),
   → call `fs_read` with `path="skills/format-pdf-hd/references/<file>"`.

Follow the instructions returned by the MCP exactly.

## This MCP is the only correct path

Produce this skill's output **only** by following the live SKILL.md fetched above and calling the `stromy-format` MCP's own tools. Do **not** substitute a local or identically-named base skill from elsewhere, and do **not** invent your own output path. A locally-produced or unbranded artifact is **wrong output, not a fallback** — it bypasses the server-side brand and quality gates.
