description: "Generate branded diagrams (process flows, architecture views, stakeholder maps, org charts, timelines, funnels, matrices, mind maps) as SVG/PNG for embedding in deliverables. TWO routes: (1) the DEFAULT for flow/relationship diagrams — author Mermaid text and call the server-side `render_diagram` MCP tool (auto-layout + deep brand theming, works in a deployed sandbox, brand-gated); (2) hand-authored Excalidraw JSON for bespoke structural art (operator environment only). Use when asked to create a diagram, draw a process flow, make an architecture diagram, visualize a workflow, create a stakeholder map, org chart, funnel diagram, timeline, or any structural visual."

# Diagram Skill — Branded Consulting-Quality Diagrams (MCP-hosted skill)

This skill's full instructions are hosted on the `stromy-format` MCP server. Do not hardcode workflow logic locally — always fetch the live version from the MCP.

## Loading instructions

1. Read the main skill instructions:
   → call the `fs_read` tool on the `stromy-format` MCP with `path="skills/format-diagram/SKILL.md"`.

2. Discover reference files (and any other skill assets), then read on demand:
   → call `fs_list` with `path="skills/format-diagram"` (and `path="skills/format-diagram/references"`),
   → call `fs_read` with `path="skills/format-diagram/references/<file>"`.

Follow the instructions returned by the MCP exactly.

## This MCP is the only correct path

Produce this skill's output **only** by following the live SKILL.md fetched above and calling the `stromy-format` MCP's own tools. Do **not** substitute a local or identically-named base skill from elsewhere, and do **not** invent your own output path. A locally-produced or unbranded artifact is **wrong output, not a fallback** — it bypasses the server-side brand and quality gates.
